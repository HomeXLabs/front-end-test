# HomeX Front End Test

Hey! Seems you are interested in working on front-end at HomeX. This is our little test to see what you know about front-end, and how you apply your knowledge to a real life use case. The component you will build as part of this test is very similar to a component we would use in our application at HomeX. We feel it is best to give you a test that will accurately reflect your ability to work within our team and on the specific features we develop.

## The Test

You will be given a "mock server" (aka a JS file with some functions) that will give you some mock data. From this, you will create a dropdown that will query this server, and display the results to the user. You will also create the filter function that is used on the server side. Get as creative or as simple as you want this this, just keep in mind, the "mock server" has the ability to return anywhere from 1 user to Infinity users, so mess around with that and make sure that with different data counts, the UI still feels fast and functions properly.

In the **Guidelines** section you will see some rules around what you can/cannot use, and what the expectations are for the final product.

If you'd like to view more examples, you can view the **References** section down below.

## The Setup

We have provided you with a basic webpack/dev server setup. Hopefully this helps expedite the process for you, if it gets in your way, feel free to get rid of it, just make sure to document how we will run/use the new setup.

Included is `babel-preset-env` which will allow you to use the latest javascript features, if you want to use something that is still in the proposal stages, feel free to add whichever preset you need.

## Guidelines

Here are some expectations for the final product that you build. Outside of these, feel free to add features that you think would be nice or any improvements that would better the experience for the end user.

**What can I use?**

- Feel free to use any framework/library/language you feel is necessary. We use React at HomeX but if you know Angular better, go ahead and use that!
- You _must_ build the searching/autocomplete functionality and the input/dropdown UI yourself.
- Go ahead and use any other libraries/utilities etc that provide additional benefit for you.

**What should a user be able to do?**

- As I type, I should get relevant results based on my input
- As I type, the results should have the search match highlighted
- Once I get my result, I should be able to select it and have it persist in the input

**What other requirements are there?**

- It should be semi pretty, not everyone is a design legend, but we'd like to see what you can do.
- It should be keyboard accessible. Accessibility matters to us and it is something we have to consider when building UI components.

## Submission

To submit the test, ZIP up your project (including this README) and email it to [amanda@homex.com](mailto:amanda@homex.com).

### References

Here are some other components/libraries that have the same/similar functionality to what you are expected to build, feel free to take a look at them to see what we have in mind, but remember, you cannot use them as part of your submission.
